# Document Question Answering (DQA) System

The DQA system is a Streamlit-based application that leverages the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo (LLM) to seamlessly upload documents and provide insightful responses to questions directly related to the document's content.

## Introduction

The DQA (Document Question Answering) system automatically answers questions based on the content of a given document. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Create a Conda Environment**:
   ```sh
   conda create -n docbot
   ```

2. **Activate the Conda Environment**:
   ```sh
   conda activate docbot
   ```

3. **Unzip the DQA.zip File**:
   - Navigate to the DQA folder.
   - Ensure you have the necessary files for the setup.

4. **Install the Required Packages**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration

1. **Configure the API Key**:
   - Open the `DQA_bot.py` file.
   - Navigate to line 32 (or the section where the API key is configured).
   - Insert your OpenAI API key. This key is crucial for the app to access the OpenAI API and generate responses.

### Running the App

1. **Run the Streamlit App**:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## DQA Pipeline

The pipeline of the Document Question Answering (DQA) system includes the following steps:

1. **Document Input**:
   - Users upload a document (pdf, docx, txt).
   - This document serves as the primary source of information for the DQA system.

2. **Document Indexing**:
   - The document undergoes an indexing process.
   - This step involves parsing and structuring the content for efficient retrieval and analysis.

3. **OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo (LLM)**:
   - The system uses OpenAI's powerful language model, GPT-3.5 Turbo (LLM).
   - This model is responsible for natural language understanding and question-answering.

4. **User Query Input**:
   - Users input their queries or select from predefined sample questions.
   - These queries are formulated in plain language and are the basis for generating relevant responses.

5. **Query Processing**:
   - The user's query is processed and prepared for interaction with the language model.
   - This ensures it is clear and contextually appropriate.

6. **Response Generation**:
   - The processed query is passed to the LLM.
   - The LLM utilizes its extensive language understanding to generate accurate responses based on the content of the indexed document.

7. **Response Display**:
   - The generated response is then displayed to the user in real-time.
   - This allows for a seamless and informative interaction.

## User Interface

Here are the step-by-step instructions for using the Streamlit-based Document Question Answering (DQA) app:

1. **Access the App**:
   - After accessing the app, you will be directed to the main user interface (UI).

2. **Upload Documents**:
   - On the sidebar of the UI, you will find the "Browse" option.
   - This feature allows you to upload files of your choice or select from a set of predefined sample documents available.

3. **Document Indexing**:
   - Upon selecting a document, the app will begin the process of indexing it.
   - The time required for this indexing process may vary depending on the size of the chosen document.

4. **Enter Queries**:
   - Once the document is successfully indexed, the screen will prompt you to enter your query or question for the bot.
   - Additionally, you will have the option to choose from a list of predefined sample questions.

5. **Generate Responses**:
   - After you've entered your query or selected a sample question, click on the "Generate Response" button to initiate the response generation process by the bot.
   - The output text generated by the bot will be streamed in the response section of the app, allowing you to view and interact with the bot's responses.

6. **Prompt History**:
   - The DQA system incorporates a dedicated Prompt History section.
   - Here, users can conveniently access and review a history of their previous queries and prompts, ensuring easy reference and continuity in their document exploration journey.
